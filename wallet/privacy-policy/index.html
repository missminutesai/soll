Where we have your consent (including when you change a mobile device or reset an advertising ID or cookies), we may send direct marketing communications including push notifications to you. Whenever you receive direct marketing from us you will be told how you can unsubscribe so that you no longer receive it. When we communicate with you via email you will also be given the opportunity to set or amend any preferences that you have indicated to us.</p><p>You are also able at any time to withdraw any consent to receive marketing communications that you have given to us. You can do this by contacting us at <a href="https://www.solflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6a1a18031c0b09132a1905060c060b180f44090507"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0272706b7463617b42716d6e646e6370672c616d6f">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Third-party marketing</strong>. We will request your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.<br><br><strong>Opting out</strong>. You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time. Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a service purchase, service experience or other transactions.</p><p><strong>Cookies</strong>: these are alphanumeric identifiers that we place on your device through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies. Session cookies stay on your computer during your browser session and are deleted after the session ends. We use session cookies to understand site traffic and usage, including pages visited and countries of visitors. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our website may become inaccessible or not function properly.</p><p><strong>Change of purpose</strong>. We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p><p><strong>Disclosures</strong> of your personal data. We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table above.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Third parties as set out in the Glossary below.</li><li>Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our website.</li><li>IT and software providers who supply us with our IT infrastructure for the provision of our services and administering our business (including our internal and external communications) and who also help us manage our customer and contact databases, customer relationships and marketing.</li><li>Any other business partners, suppliers and subcontractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with you.</li></ul><p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p><p>We review all our relationships with third parties carefully so that we can be sure as possible that their practices match our own commitments to you relating to privacy and security.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. International transfers</strong></h2><p>We share your personal data within the Solflare group of companies. This may involve transferring your data outside the British Virgin Islands. We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our group companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data. These rules are called &#8220;binding corporate rules&#8221;.</p><p>Some of our external third parties are based outside the British Virgin Islands so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the British Virgin Islands. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the British Virgin Islands, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it in accordance with the Data Protection Act in the British Virgin Islands which give personal data the same protection it has in the British Virgin Islands.</p><p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism we use when transferring your personal data out of the British Virgin Islands.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Data security</strong></h2><p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Data retention</strong></h2><p>How long we keep your information will depend on the purpose for which we use it and so may vary. We will only retain your information for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and as is necessary to comply with our legal obligations. We do not keep more information than we need for the particular purpose.</p><p>Where we have provided you with a service, we may keep an archived record of your personal data for a period of up to 7 years after termination (unless a longer period is prescribed by law) for the purposes of responding to legal disputes and legal or regulatory enquiries or investigations only, but will not use this data for any other purpose.</p><p>In order to ensure that we provide reliable and effective services, and to comply with our regulatory obligations, we regularly make back-up copies of our data. If we have provided any services to you then this will include your personal data. Where we delete your personal data from our systems, for whatever reason, a copy may be retained in our data back-ups for a period of up to 90 days afterwards. These are kept securely and only accessed in order to delete old versions or in the event of an emergency which means we have to utilise a back-up copy to reinstate data on our active systems. Where we have to do this, we will work to ensure as soon as we reasonably can that the copy of the data that has been used to reinstate data on our active systems is updated to take account of any previous amendments and deletions regarding your personal data.</p><p>If you ask us to stop sending direct marketing communications to you (see section 3, above), we will keep the minimum amount of information necessary (such as your name and email address) to ensure that we are able to adhere to your request. We also routinely seek to minimise the amount of personal data we hold where any marketing contact is deemed inactive. We deem a contact to be inactive if we have not been able to identify any engagement (e.g. through opening an email or visiting our website) for a period of 12 months or if an email is not delivered due to a hard bounce. In such circumstances we will anonymise all relevant data for aggregation purposes, with the exception of an email address. This does not affect your rights as set out in section 7 of this Privacy Policy.<br></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Your legal rights</strong></h2><p><strong>Request access to your personal data</strong> (commonly known as a &#8220;data subject access request&#8221;). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p><p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p><p><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p><p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p><p><strong>Request restriction</strong> of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li><li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li><li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li><li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li></ul><p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p><p>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p><p>These rights are limited in some situations. For example, if we have a legal requirement or a compelling legitimate ground, we may continue to process your data even where you request its deletion.</p><p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details in the Contact section below.</p><p>You also have the right to make a complaint if you feel your personal data has been mishandled. We would encourage you to contact us in the first instance but you are also entitled to complain directly to your local data protection authority.</p><p><strong>No fee usually required</strong>. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p><p><strong>Time limit to respond</strong>. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8.

We may ask authorised agents to submit proof of their authority to make a request, such as a valid power of attorney or proof that they have signed permission from the consumer who is the subject of the request. In some cases, we may be required to contact the individual who is the subject of the request to verify his or her own identity or confirm the authorised agent has permission to submit the request.

We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p><p><strong>Performance of contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
